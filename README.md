## :pencil2: Planning & Problem Solving
It was my first CRUD project. first I started working about idea to have fun part and also have parctical use as well. Second I strated Wireframing my page and take note how to approach for the next step.
The first problem I had was with css so I decided to make functionalty works after that if I had time come back and do css. Second problem I had encountered was after user login to website they only can edit and delete their own database, the way I approach to solve it was to use session to make that happen.
